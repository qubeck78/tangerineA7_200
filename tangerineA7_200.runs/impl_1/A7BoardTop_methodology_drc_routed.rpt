HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) sdCardDat[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sdCardDat[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.

TIMING-16#69 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.700 ns between tangerineSOCInst/usbHostInst/usb_hid_host0Inst/reportPulse_reg/C (clocked by clk12_clk_wiz_1) and tangerineSOCInst/usbHostInst/fifoHidKeyboardWrEn_reg/D (clocked by clk100_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sdCardClk relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sdCardCmd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
