Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
