2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg__0 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
