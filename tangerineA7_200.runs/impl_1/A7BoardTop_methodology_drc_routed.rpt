HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) sdCardDat[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sdCardDat[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
