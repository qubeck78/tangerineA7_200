2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) sdCardDat[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sdCardDat[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg__0 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sdCardDat[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sdCardClk relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sdCardCmd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk50.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
