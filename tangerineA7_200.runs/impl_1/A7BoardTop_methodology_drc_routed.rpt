DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/blitterInst/dpSa1 input pin tangerineSOCInst/blitterInst/dpSa1/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset.

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tangerineSOCInst/sdramDMAInst/sdramCKE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
