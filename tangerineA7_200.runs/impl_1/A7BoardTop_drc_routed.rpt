DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 output tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 output tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 multiplier stage tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 multiplier stage tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

DPOP-2#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg multiplier stage tangerineSOCInst/picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.

PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A4' of cell tangerineSOCInst/UARTInst/rxFiFoInst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/gr1.gr1_int.rfwft/gpregsm1.user_valid_i_1 (pin tangerineSOCInst/UARTInst/rxFiFoInst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/gr1.gr1_int.rfwft/gpregsm1.user_valid_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6)+((~A6)*(~A5)*A3)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
